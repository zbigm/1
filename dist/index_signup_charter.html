                    <p >Here are some promises you make to us in this Contract:</p>
                    <p >You’re eligible to enter into this Contract and you are at least our “Minimum Age.”</p>
                    <p >The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.</p>
                    <p >To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the “Minimum Age” (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one AAECA account (and/or one SlideShare account, if applicable), which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by AAECA from using the Services.</p>
                    <p >Members who were below this new Minimum Age when they started using the Services under a previous User Agreement may continue to use them, as they have already reached the new Minimum Age since then or will reach it in the near future.</p>
                    <p >“Minimum Age” means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for AAECA to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using of your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age.</p>

                    <h5 class="submain-subtitle text-left">2.2 Your Account</h5>
                    <p >You’ll keep your password a secret.</p>
                    <p > You will not share an account with anyone else and will follow our rules and the law.</p>
                    <p>Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) try to choose a strong and secure password; (2) keep your password secure and confidential; (3) not transfer any part of your account (e.g., connections) and (4) follow the law and our list of Dos and Don’ts. You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse.</p>
                    <p>As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g. Recruiter seat bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account.</p>

                    <p>You’ll honor your payment obligations and you are okay with us storing your payment information. You understand that AAECA may charge you a membership fee.</p>
                    <p>We don't guarantee refunds.</p>
                    <p>If you buy any of our paid Services (“Premium Services”), you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and to additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that:</p>
                    <p>Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g. exchange rates).</p>
                    <p>We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g. credit card) even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your Services and to use to pay other Services you may buy.</p>
                    <p>We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us at the time of purchase.</p>
                    <p>You can get a copy of your invoice through your AAECA account settings under “Purchase History”.</p>

                    <p>You agree that we will provide notices to you in the following ways: (1) a notice within the Service, or (2) a message sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact information up to date.</p>

                    <p>When you share information, others can see, copy and use that information.
                        Our Services allow messaging and sharing of information in many ways, such as your profile, slide deck, links to news articles, job postings, InMails and blogs. Information and content that you share or post may be seen by other Members or Visitors. Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to AAECA connections, restricting your profile visibility from search engines, or opting not to notify others of your AAECA profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections network or the public. So if you apply for a job through our Service or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster.
                    </p>
                    <p>We are not obligated to publish any information or content on our Service and can remove it in our sole discretion, with or without notice.</p>

                    <p>We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored content).

                        While we may edit and make formatting changes to your content (such as translating it, modifying the size, layout or file type or removing metadata), we will not modify the meaning of your expression.
                    </p>
                    <p>Because you own your content and information and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to others, including under the terms of a Creative Commons license.</p>

                    <p>You are responsible for deciding if you want to access or use third party apps or sites that link from our Services. If you allow a third party app or site to authenticate you or connect with your AAECA account, that app or site can access information on AAECA related to you and your connections. Third party apps and sites have their own legal terms and privacy policies, and you may be giving others permission to use your information in ways we would not. Except to the limited extent it may be required by applicable law, AAECA is not responsible for these other sites and apps – use these at your own risk. Please see our Privacy Policy.</p>

                    <p>Here are some important details about how to read the Contract.</p>
                    <p>If a court with authority over this Contract finds any part of it not enforceable, you and us agree that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent. If the court cannot do that, you and us agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this Contract. To the extent allowed by law, the English language version of this Contract is binding and other translations are for convenience only. This Contract (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services.</p>
                    <p>If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Contract, that does not mean that AAECA has waived its right to enforce this Contract. You may not assign or transfer this Contract (or your membership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent. However, you agree that AAECA may assign this Contract to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent. There are no third party beneficiaries to this Contract.</p>
                    <p>We reserve the right to change the terms of this Contract and will provide you notice if we do and we agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you don't agree to these changes, you must stop using the Services.
                        You agree that the only way to provide us legal notice is at the addresses provided in Section 10.
